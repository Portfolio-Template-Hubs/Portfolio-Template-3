    --light-color: #f8f9fa; /* Light background color */
    /* ... other variables ... */
}
```

To add a new project, copy the project card structure in the Projects section and customize it:

```html
<div class="project-card">
    <div class="project-image">
        <!-- Add your project image here -->
        <div class="project-placeholder" aria-label="Project screenshot"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="project-content">
        <h3>Your Project Title</h3>
        <p>Description of your project goes here.</p>
        <div class="project-tags">
            <span>HTML</span>
            <span>CSS</span>
            <!-- Add more technologies -->
        </div>
        <div class="project-links">
